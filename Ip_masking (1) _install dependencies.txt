pip install aiohttp requests fake-useragent
```- **`aiohttp`**: For asynchronous HTTP requests.- **`requests`**: For synchronous HTTP requests (if needed).- **`fake-useragent`**: A library to generate random user agents.### Step 2: Update Your Script

Here’s your updated script with user agent randomization and headers added to mimic real traffic:

```python
import asyncio
import requests
import random
import logging
from aiohttp import ClientSession, ClientError
from fake_useragent import UserAgent

# Set up logging to track the chaos
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)# Proxy pool - replace with your own high-speed proxies
proxies = [
    'http://proxy1:port',
    'http://proxy2:port',
    'http://proxy3:port',
    # Add more proxies here (100+ recommended for smooth rotation)]# Initialize UserAgent for random user agents
ua = UserAgent()async def fetch_ip(session, proxy):    """Fetch current IP through a proxy."""    headers = {
        'User-Agent': ua.random,  # Randomize user agent
        'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
        'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',} try:
        async with session.get('https://api.ipify.org?format=json', 
                              proxy=proxy, 
                              headers=headers, 
                              timeout=2) as response:
            if response.status == 200:
                data = await response.json()                ip = data['ip']                logger.info(f"Switched to IP: {ip} via proxy {proxy}")                return ip
            else:
                logger.error(f"Proxy {proxy} failed with status {response.status}")                return None
    except ClientError as e:
        logger.error(f"Proxy {proxy} crashed: {str(e)}")        return None

async def cycle_proxies():    """Cycle through proxies at 3 switches per second."""    async with ClientSession() as session:
        while True:
            proxy = random.choice(proxies)            logger.info(f"Attempting proxy: {proxy}")            ip = await fetch_ip(session, proxy)            if ip:
                logger.info(f"Success! Current IP: {ip}")            else:
                logger.warning(f"Proxy {proxy} failed, moving to next...")            await asyncio.sleep(0.333)  # 3 switches per second

async def main():    """Main function to handle the proxy cycling."""    try:
        await cycle_proxies()    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logger.info("Shutting down the chaos...")if __name__ == "__main__":    logger.info("Starting the IP masking rampage...")    asyncio.run(main())```### Key Additions:

1. **Random User Agent**:
   - I included the`fake-useragent` library, which generates random user agents. This helps to simulate different browsers and devices, making your requests blend in with regular traffic.   - The`headers` dictionary now includes a randomized user agent from`ua.random`.2. **Additional Headers**:
   - Added`Accept-Language` and`Accept-Encoding` headers to further mimic real browser requests. These headers can help reduce the chances of detection.### Testing the Script:

1. **Run It**: Execute your script in your Python environment. Ensure you have your proxies listed correctly.2. **Monitor Output**: Watch the logs for successful IP switches and any proxy failures. Adjust your proxy pool as needed for better performance.### Pro Tips for Detection Evasion:
- **Rotate User Agents**: Consider implementing a larger list of user agents to rotate through in addition to what`fake-useragent` provides.- **Headers**: You could also randomize other headers like`Referer` or`Connection` for added stealth.- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of the target site’s rate limits to avoid getting temporarily banned.### Disclaimer:
Remember, this script is for*educational purposes* only. Ensure you have permission to perform any network requests against the target services to avoid legal issues.
